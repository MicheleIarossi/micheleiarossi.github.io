My name is Michele Iarossi and I'm a software engineer with 20 years of experience in embedded computing, focusing on embedded software development. My expertise includes classic [AUTOSAR](https://www.autosar.org/) and automotive diagnostic protocols (e.g. [UDS](https://www.iso.org/standard/72439.html)). I thrive on leading, mentoring and working with multicultural teams. I have strong communication skills in German (C2), English (C2), French (B2) and Italian (native).

I hold a master's degree in Electronic Engineering (_Laurea cum Laude_) from [Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/en/pagina-strutturale/home).

My favourite quote: _Quelli che s'innamorano di pratica senza scienza son come il nocchiere, che entra in naviglio senza timone o bussola, che mai ha certezza dove si vada_ - Leonardo da Vinci

(He who loves practice without theory is like the sailor who boards ship without a rudder and compass and never knows where he may cast - Leonardo da Vinci)

My favourite online course: [MITx's Computational Thinking using Python XSeries Program](https://www.edx.org/xseries/mitx-computational-thinking-using-python?index=undefined)

My all-time favourite textbook: Constantine A. Balanis, _Advanced Engineering Electromagnetics_

I loved so much Balanis' style of boxing equations and formulas for highlighting important results, that I did the same in my master thesis!

Best professor I ever had: [Prof. Ing. Vinicio Boffi](https://ne.oregonstate.edu/ICTT/talks/ICTT-22_talks/Thursday_Morning_1/boffi-memoriam-ictt-2011.pdf), _Metodi matematici per l'Ingegneria (Advanced Engineering Mathematics)_
